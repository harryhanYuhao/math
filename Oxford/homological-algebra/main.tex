\abstract{
	This mini-project was submitted for assessment for the Homological Algebra course at University of Oxford on Spring 2026.
	The goal of this mini-project was to study simplicial objects, cotriple cohomology, and Hochschild cohomology.
	Most of the theorems and defintions were taken from \textit{Higher Topos Theory} by Lurie \cite{lurie} and \textit{An Introduction to Homological Algebra} by Weibel \cite{weibel}.
	Most of the proofs, however, contain at least some original ideas, as they were ``left as exercises'' by Lurie and Weibel.
