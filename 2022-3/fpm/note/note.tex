\begin{abstract}
	These are my notes when taking the class \textit{Fundamentals of Pure Mathematics} at the University of Edinburgh. They are not a replicate of the lecture notes: they are my thoughts and explorations. 
	Most importantly, all proofs presented in this document are of my own conception. 

	Terms like ``Theorem, Proposition'' are coined in Latin. As the English terms descended from Latin, most of them are self-explanatory.
