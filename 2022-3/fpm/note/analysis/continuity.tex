\subsection{Continuity}

\begin{definition}[Continuity of a Function]\label{def:Continuity}
	Function $f: \bb{D} \rightarrow \bb{R}$ (provided $\bb{D} \subseteq \bb{R}$) is continuous at $a$
	if and only if for all sequence $(x_i)$ (provided $x_i \in \bb{D}$) that converges to $a$ the sequence $(f(x_i))$ converges to $f(a)$.

	If the function $f$ is continuous for all $a \in \bb{A}$, we say $f$ is continous on the interval $\bb{A}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Equivalent Defintion]
	The definition \ref{def:Continuity} of function $f:\mathbb{D} \rightarrow \bb{R}$ is continuous at $a\in \bb{D}$ is equivalent to $\lim _{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)$, provided $\bb{D}$ is a non-degenerate interval in $\bb{R}$; 
	i.e. $\forall \epsilon \in \bb{D} \exists \delta $ such that $|x-a| < \delta \implies |f(x)-f(a)| < \epsilon$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Extreme Value Theorem]
	$f:\bb{I} \rightarrow \bb{R}$ where $\bb{I}$ is a close interval of real number is bounded.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	The extreme value theorem does not hold when $\bb{I}$ is a close interval. For example, function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ is continous but unbounded in the open interval $(0,1)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Intermediate Value Theorem]
	Let $f: \bb{D} \rightarrow \bb{R}$ be continuous on the interval $[a,b]\in \bb{D}$. $\forall c $ such that $f(a)<c<f(b)\ \exists d \in [a,b] $ such that $ f(d) = c$.  
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Intermediate Value Theorem]
	Construct a set $\bb{E} = \{e\in [a,b]| f(e)<c\}$. Since $f(a)<c$, $\bb{E}$ is non empty.  
	As $\bb{E}$ is bounded, by the completeness of real number, there exists a supremum , which shall be denoted as $\sup{\bb{E}}=s$. 
	As $\bb{E}$ is bounded by a close inteval, $s$ is also bounded by the same intevral. Our aim is to show that $f(s)=c$.

	By our assumption $f$ is continous at $s$. Assuming $f(s) < c$. 
	Since $f$ is continous as $s$, there exists $\delta \in \bb{R}$ such that for all $s<x<\delta$, $|f(x)-f(s)|<c-f(s)$, i.e., $f(s)<f(x)<c$, contradicting our assumption that $s$ is the supremum of $\bb{E}$. 
	Thus we conlude $f(s)\geq c$. $f(s)\leq c$ can be proved similarly.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	The sequence definition of continuity sets no restrains on the domains of the function. Indeed by this definition all discrete functions are continuous: contradicting our intuition about continuity.
	
	The more important consequence of continuity relies heavily on the properties of real number, i.e, the completeness of real number.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Bizare Functions}
\begin{hypothesis}
	\ 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is there a function $f: \bb{R} \rightarrow \bb{R}$ such that for all invertal $[a,b] \in \bb{R}$, $f$ is neither strictly increasing or decreasing? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{hypothesis}
