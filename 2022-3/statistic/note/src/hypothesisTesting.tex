\section{Overview}
We never accept null hypothesis. We never reject alternative hypothesis. 
It is either we fail to reject null hypothesis or we reject null hypothesis in favor of some alternative.
\begin{definition}[Type I, II error]
Type I error is to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis when it is true. Type II error is to incorrectly fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.

The probability of incurring a Type 1 error is the significance level of the hypothesis and is denoted by $\alpha$. The probability of incurring a Type II error is denoted by $\beta$. $1-\beta$ is called the power of the test.
