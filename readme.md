Math Notes & Explorations
---

This repository contains my math notes both written following the courses at the University of Edinburgh and by my own explorations.
Even the course notes contain more of my thoughts rather than being a $$\LaTeX$$ replicate of the lecture notes.

As I am one of the rare combined species of Latin and math student in the 21st century, I have included Latin in my notes where appropriate to revitalize this classical language of Cicero and Virgil.
