==== Unstable

A critical point $x_0$ of the autonomous system $bold(x)' = bold(F)(bold(x))$ is not stable if there exists $epsilon>0$ such that for all $delta>0$, there exists a solution $bold(x)(t)$, that for all $t>0$

$ || bold(x)(0) - bold(x)_0 || < delta and || bold(x)(t) - bold(x)_0 || > epsilon $ 

==== Unattractive

A critical point $x_0$ of the autonomous system $bold(x)' = bold(F)(bold(x))$ is not attractive if for all $delta>0$ there exists a solution $bold(x)(t)$ such that 

$ lim_(t -> infinity) bold(x)(t) != bold(x)_0 $

i.e., either the limit does not exist, or it converges to other value.

==== Unasymptotically Stable

A critical point $x_0$ of the autonomous system $bold(x)' = bold(F)(bold(x))$ is not asymptotically stable if it is not stable or not attractive.
